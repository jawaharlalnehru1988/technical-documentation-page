    <p>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

JavaScript is easy to learn.

This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.</p>
<p>
  JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
</p>
    <code>
 let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
    </code>

    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
    <code>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The temperature is " + toCelsius(77) + " Celsius";

function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);</code>
    
  <ul>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Control Flow</li>
    <li>Promises</li>
    <li>The Strange Parts</li>
  </ul>

    <p>What is a variable?
A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.</p>
    <p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.

One special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers. Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as you go along.</p>
    <code>myFunction();

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML =
  typeof carName + " " + carName;
}

document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =
typeof carName;</code>

    <p>Is JavaScript the Future? Indeed, It Is!

Future is uncertain and mysterious. However, these very qualities of the forthcoming motivate humans to try to predict it, may it be in the context of human existence or technology. Talking about technology, programming languages have become vital to it in the 21st-century.</p>
    <p>We’ve all sorts of programming languages capable of accomplishing a diverse range of tasks. JavaScript is one of the leading programming languages. In fact, it is called the programming language of the web. JS is a part of the ever-increasing number of programming options, many of which are, in actual fact, inspired from it.</p>
    <code>let car = "Fiat";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = car;</code>

    <header>Functions</header>
    <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

</p>
    <p>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}</p>
    <code>
      var x = myFunction(4, 3);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;

function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
    </code>
